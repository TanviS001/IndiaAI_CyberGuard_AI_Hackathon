- **External Tools**: Google Colab, GitHub, Google Search, Google Scholar

- **AI Tools and Usage:**
This project leveraged OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google Gemini for:
  - Generating ideas for efficient text preprocessing techniques.
  - Clarifying concepts related to natural language processing and machine learning.
  - Debugging Python code
  - Providing optimization suggestions which were reviewed, validated, and implemented by the developer.
  
All outputs from ChatGPT, Gemini were critically analyzed, modified, and implemented by developer to align with project requirements.
ChatGPT, Gemini served as a productivity booster rather than a direct contributor to the code.
