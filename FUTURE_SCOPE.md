# Future scope:

From my observations: 

1.   Processing of Hindi text, Hindi words written in English must be performed to make accurate predictions
2.   class imbalances should be reduced. For this we can use 'SMOTE' 
3.   SMOTE can be useful for generating more entries, training the model and reducing the class imbalances 
4.   More advanced NLP Models can be leveraged
